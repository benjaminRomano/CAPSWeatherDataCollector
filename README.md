# CAPSWeatherDataCollector
Created a NOAA Weather data collector that then feeds the data into Google Earth. 
Once the data is collected, a user can then go back and re-watch historical data. 
This project was created using ASP.NET Web API and Entity Framework to provide a REST API, and a C# console application to collect the data.

Data formats supported: any images, KMZ, KML 


NOTE: I'm going to add better documentation when I'm closer to final release
